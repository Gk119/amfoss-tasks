## Programming
This is the task I enjoyed doing the most as I like solving coding challenges. I had stayed up a lot of late nights trying to solve the problems and thinking of different approaches. Even though some of the problems were challenging I managed to solve them after a lot of work.

There were many times when the code worked but the exceeded the time limit for some cases. For those problems I had to optimise the code a lot to or in some cases had to take completely different approach to solving the problem keeping the run time in mind. For few other questions though I unnecessarily overcomplicated the the steps where I couldve solved it in an easier way in less time. 

Below is a list of the interesting problems and my experience solving them:

#### 1.The Game I must Lose
This problem was fairly easy and once we figured out th necessary condition for winning which was that the number sandesh chooses must have less number of factors of two than what is chose by his girlfriend.

#### 2.Lisa and Shelves
This is one of the problems where I uneccesarily complicated the code first. My first approach was to find all the prime factors and to take all the possible permutation of them in twos which was highly time consuming since the numbers involved were large and finding their prime factors was hard and to take all their permutation was also tricky. After a lot of brain-storming I realised that just taking number of factors was necessary and the answer can be found from that.

#### 3.Bumper Cars
This was a tricky but not hard problem. I had made a small computer game in which I had already written collission algorithms for which made it easy for me to calculate collisions for this proble and take the neccesarry steps.

#### 4.Fights On
This is the problem in which I spent the most time solving. Initially I used an approach that was highly memory and time intensive. I tried a lot of optimisiations but it still was not enough as the code still had to iterate through array with large number of elements multiple times. After days of brain-storming I came up with the different approach which got rid of the big arrays altogether and worked in given time span.

#### 5.Aver Max 
This was an easy problem in which we can get the answer without actually calculating for it. Also this is the only hackerank challege which I solved with Python instead of C++.

#### 6. Ram and Gifts
This was the hardest problem of all for me. I got a working algorithm after trying a lot but still many cases were getting time out error. After a lot of modification I managed to reduce time out error to 3 cases. I even tried storing all the output in a buffer to print together to reduce the printing time but that didnt change anything so left that method. Finally I found an algorithm on internet to get a formula to calculate the nth term of a second order reccursive function which is whats in the question on 18th Nov and I thought of trying that method out but I got busy with other tasks and by then the challenge closed. This was the only problem I wasnt able to solve in the challenge.

Rest all problems were fairly easy to do.
