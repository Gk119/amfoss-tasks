## JSExplorer

I had previously desinged a small website for fun using HTML and CSS but this is the first time I am using JavaScript. The task was moderately easy and the only time consuming parts was understanding which tags/script to use where. Identifying the some of the errors also took time. I had to eventually use two javascript functions from stackoverflow to force download the Image in button 1 at page-2 as I couldnt find a way to download a Image rather than opening it with HTML and client side programming. Parsing the data from JSON in page-3 was easy this time as we had already worked with JOSN in task-04.
