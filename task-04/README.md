## Aerglo Mars
This is the first time I'm using APIs and argparse. I did struggle with argparse a bit in the starting but that was sorted out with the help of kind strangers 
from stackoverflow. I also learned further about JSON and understood more about them. It was also fun to look into the photos from Mars.
