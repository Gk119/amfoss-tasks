## Introduction
I am someone who is fascinated by technology and the advancements in it. So naturally I started learning to code by myself in 9th and have taught myself C++ and Arduino programming. Other than that I read a lot of books watch movies and scroll memes. I reside in Kollam, Kerala since 11th grade.

I am happy now that I am studying a course related to my interests and look forward to contributng to the coding community and using the knwoledge I will gain for a positive impact on the world. 

## My View on the Tasks
The tasks were well selected as it contained the right amount of easy and hard tasks. Most of the tasks could be solved with some effort while a few were very challenging and some very easy. The tasks were also from different domains introducing us to different concepts like programming, syntax correction, App development, working with JSON, using Linux and Git, web scrapping ect. By solving these different tasks, now I am better at identifying patterns, being able to search and identify a problem and learning new skills required for a new domain.
