## Rich Scrapper
This was one of the hardest tasks for me till now. I had initially tried to solve it but kept it for later since I couldnt make any progress. Even this time it was very harrd and confusing. Initially I tried to solve it with colly package but since that didnt work I tried geziyor. In that also I used had used the method for statis pages initially which didnt work. Finally the JS version shown in the examples started giving some results and I built the rest of the code on top of that.
