## My Flutter APP
This is my first time creating mobile applications. The introduction screen Flutter Package really made a lot of the process really easy. Since I am new to this I had faced trouble on not knowing what to google and I had eventually figure it out somehow. Initially I had faced some trouble installing and setting up Android Studio and Flutter and my directory permissions got changed which caused some trouble in the working of the other apps to. My mentors helped me set some of the permissions back to normal and I later installed Android Studio in a working directory and made the program.
