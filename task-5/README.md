## Let me C
This is one of the tasks I enjoyed doing. Clearing the syntax errors were easy. 
But for the rest of the debugging I had to closely inspect each case and create a flow chart in my mind. 
Had to modify few wrong conditionals in the code. A sneaky semicolon which was hidden above opening curly braces of an if statement caused a lot of trouble. 
Also the fflush(stdin) was behaving unexpecetdly and I had to manually clear a new line charcter from input buffer at one place
