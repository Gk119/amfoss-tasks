## Introspection
### 1. Why you must chose me
I am a highly motivated individual who has a passion for programming. I have been having programming as a hobby since 9th grade and have completed multiple personal projects over the span of these years. I am willing to put in the work and constant effort required to become a valuable member of the club and contibute and learn from its projects.
### 2. What are my plans for the next six months
Within the next 6 months I plan to complete all my personal coding projects which i had kept aside for the past one year due to studies, learn a new programming language and also practise solving different coding problems. Other than these I also wish to complete reading few books in my to-read list.
### 3. How would I contribute back to the club
I have a passion for programming and willingness to learn more. Over the past few years of learning programming some of the imporatnt skills I learned was how to teach oneself about new things and how to ask(Google ;)) the right question.I belive I can use these skills for solving the challenges and problems put forward to us in the club more efficiently. Further I have lead and worked with various teams for projects and organising events and has experince in working in a team with which I will able to contribute to the club.
### 4. My feedback for the selection process
The slection process was easy and the mentors are very friendly and helped us when we faced any technical difficulty or if we had any doubts regarding the process and tasks. Looking forward to meeting them once the college begins.
